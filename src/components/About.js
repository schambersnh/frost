            <li>(1) pack of beer</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We will have all of these as well, but it will help ensure the house does not run dry with the large amount of participants!</p>

          <h2>Events</h2>
          <p>There will be six olympic style events in total and a cookie competition.</p>
          <p>You will not know the games until the day of the event. We as hosts will obviously know them, but you can trust that we will not practice or do anything nefarious. The integrity of F.R.O.S.T is of the utmost importance to us.</p>
          <p>Before each event, your team must nominate one player to participate. The nomination will happen before the event is announced. If you are a team of 1, you will play each event. If you are a team of 2 you will play a total of 3 events. Young children can help or play as an individual.</p>

          <h2>Cookie Competition</h2>
          <p className="note"><strong>Note:</strong> please consult the survey before baking the cookie to ensure that allergies are accounted for!</p>

          <p>For the purposes of this competition, a cookie is defined as any small, sweet, handheld dessert item. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Traditional drop, rolled, bar, or molded cookies</li>
            <li>Layered or filled confections such as 7-layer cookies, rainbow cookies, and sandwich-style cookies</li>
            <li>Nut-based or coconut-based items such as macaroons</li>
            <li>Small filled pastries, provided they are presented as individual servings</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Cookies may be baked or no-bake, and may incorporate a wide range of ingredients and techniques. Entries should be individually portioned, transportable by hand, and intended to be eaten without utensils.</p>

          <p>The goal of the cookie competition is to be anonymous. The expectation is that the cookie will be baked prior to arriving at the house. Once everyone's cookies have arrived, we ask that you taste each cookie from the time the party starts, until thirty minutes after the last game. We will provide printouts to score the cookies. The cookies will be judged on the following criteria:</p>

          <h3>Presentation</h3>
          <p>Get creative, not just the presentation of the cookie itself but anything you decide to present your cookie on. Skies the limit, anything you bring is fair game.</p>

          <h3>Taste</h3>
          <p>What is this cookie's flavor characteristic? Is it perfectly sweet? Edgy with bitterness? Enhanced with saltiness?</p>

          <h3>Texture</h3>
          <p>Is this cookie perfectly moist, chewy, crispy, crumbly, gooey?</p>

          <p>Each category will be rated 1-5. Whoever has the most total points is the winner!</p>
        </section>

        <section className="about-section">
          <h2>Total Scoring</h2>
          <p>The scoring will be based on the number of participants playing. If we have N participants:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1st place: N points</li>
            <li>2nd place: N - 2 points</li>
            <li>3rd place: N - 4 points</li>
            <li>4th place: N - 5 points</li>
            <li>5th place: N - 6 points</li>
            <li>â€¦.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Everyone will always get 1 point in the event, and this ensures that 1st, 2nd, and 3rd are special.</p>
          <p>The cookie competition winner is awarded N/2, rounded up - winner takes all.</p>
